# Welcome to Collegium Serpentis! :snake:

Collegium Serpentis is a powerful yet easy-to-use system that helps you keep track of multiple clients and their statuses in real-time. Think of it as a friendly digital registrar that always knows who's connected and what they're up to! It's built using modern tools like FastAPI for the server and WebSockets for instant updates.

## :sparkles: Cool Features

*   **Real-Time Updates**: See client registrations and status changes as they happen.
*   **WebSocket Magic**: Smooth and fast communication between server and clients.
*   **Speedy In-Memory Storage**: Uses Redis (when you're running it) to keep track of client statuses lightning fast.
*   **Modern Python Backend**: Built with asynchronous Python for great performance.

## :project_diagram: System Architecture

Here's a look at how the different parts of Collegium Serpentis fit together:

    subgraph Clients
        C1[Client 1]
        C2[Client 2]
        C3[Client N]
    end

    subgraph FastAPI_Server [FastAPI Server]
        WS[/ws WebSocket Endpoint]
        API[HTTP Endpoints e.g., /docs, /]
        AppLogic[Application Logic]
    end

## :hammer_and_wrench: What You'll Need (Prerequisites)

Before you get started, make sure you have these tools installed:

*   **Python**: Version 3.13.2 (This project uses some of the newer Python features!)
*   **Poetry**: A friendly tool for managing project dependencies. (Think of it as a smart shopping list for your project's code needs).
*   **Redis Server**: Recommended for the full experience, especially in a production-like setup. (This is our super-fast in-memory data store).
*   **Docker**: (Optional, but highly recommended!) Makes running the server and Redis a breeze.

## :rocket: Getting Started: Installation

Ready to get Collegium Serpentis running? Here's how:

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Get your own copy of the project.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/collegium_serpentis.git
    cd collegium_serpentis
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies with Poetry**: This command tells Poetry to grab all the necessary Python packages for the project.
    ```bash
    poetry install --no-root
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Install Developer Tools**: If you plan to contribute or want to run tests, get the development dependencies too.
    ```bash
    poetry install --with dev --no-root
    ```

4.  **(Optional but Recommended) Local Virtual Environment**: Tell Poetry to keep your project's Python environment neatly inside the project folder.
    ```bash
    poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
    ```

5.  **Set Up Pre-Commit Hooks**: These are little helpers that check your code for style and quality *before* you commit it. Super handy!
    ```bash
    poetry run pre-commit install
    ```

6.  **Install Redis Tools**: Useful command-line tools for interacting with Redis (if you're using it directly).
    ```bash
    sudo apt install redis-tools
    ```

## :computer: Using Collegium Serpentis

### Option 1: Running with Docker Compose (Recommended & Easiest!)

Docker Compose helps you start both the FastAPI server and the Redis database with a single command. It's like an orchestra conductor for your application services!

1.  **Build and Start**: This command builds the necessary Docker images (if they don't exist) and starts the services.
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
    *   Your server will be humming along at `http://localhost:8000`.
    *   Redis will be ready for action at `localhost:6379`.

2.  **Stop the Services**: When you're done, this command gracefully stops everything.
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

### Option 2: Running the Server Manually

If you prefer to run the server directly (without Docker for the server itself):

1.  **Start the Redis Server (Using Docker)**: It's still easiest to run Redis in Docker.
    ```bash
    docker run --rm --name redis-server -p 6379:6379 redis
    ```
    *   **Test Redis**: You can check if Redis is happy by sending it a `ping`.
        ```bash
        redis-cli ping
        ```
        You should see `PONG` in reply!

2.  **Start the FastAPI Server**: 
    ```bash
    poetry run uvicorn src.server.server:app --reload
    ```
    *   This starts the server at `http://localhost:8000`.
    *   The `--reload` flag means the server will automatically restart if you make changes to the code â€“ very useful for development!

#### Managing Your Manual Redis Container:
*   **Stopping Redis**: `docker stop redis-server`
*   **Removing Redis (once stopped)**: `docker rm redis-server`

### :mag: API Documentation

Once your server is running, you get interactive API documentation for free! Open your web browser and go to:

*   **Swagger UI (Interactive)**: `http://localhost:8000/docs` (Lets you try out the API endpoints directly!)
*   **ReDoc (Alternative View)**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### :left_right_arrow: WebSocket Endpoint

Clients connect to the server using WebSockets at this address:

```
ws://localhost:8000/ws
```

## :bar_chart: Client Status Dashboard

Here's a conceptual mockup of the Client Status Dashboard:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    subgraph Client_Status_Dashboard [Client Status Dashboard]
        direction LR

        subgraph Dashboard_Header [Header]
            direction LR
            RStatus[Redis Connection: Connected :green_circle:]
            RefreshInfo(Auto-refreshes every 5s)
        end
        
        subgraph Client_List_Section [Clients]
            direction TD
            CL_Header["Client ID | Status | Last Seen / Disconnected | Details"]
            
            C1["client_alpha_123 | Connected :large_green_circle: | Last Seen: 10:35:02 UTC | CPU: 45%, RAM: 60%"]
            C2["client_beta_456 | Connected :large_green_circle: | Last Seen: 10:34:58 UTC | Task: Processing Batch A"]
            C3["client_gamma_789 | Disconnected :red_circle: | Disconnected: 2023-10-26 09:15:30 UTC | N/A"]
            C4["client_delta_000 | Connected :large_green_circle: | Last Seen: 10:35:05 UTC | Idle"]
            C5["... more clients ..."]

            CL_Header --- C1;
            CL_Header --- C2;
            CL_Header --- C3;
            CL_Header --- C4;
            CL_Header --- C5;
        end
        
        Dashboard_Header --> Client_List_Section;
    end

    %% Styling (optional, for better visual separation if rendered)
    classDef header fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef clientlist fill:#lightgrey,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
    classDef clientdetails stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,fill:#fff;

    class Dashboard_Header header;
    class Client_List_Section clientlist;
    class CL_Header,C1,C2,C3,C4,C5 clientdetails;
```

Want to see who's connected? There's a handy web page for that!

Once the server is running (e.g., via `docker-compose up` or manually), open your browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

**The dashboard shows you:**

*   Whether the Redis server is connected.
*   A list of all clients:
    *   Their unique ID.
    *   Connection Status (Connected :green_circle: / Disconnected :red_circle:).
    *   Last Seen time (for those online) or Disconnect Time (for those offline).
    *   Any other status details the clients might send.
*   The dashboard refreshes automatically every 5 seconds, so you always have the latest info!

## :sleuth_or_spy: Testing Your Setup

We use `pytest` to make sure everything is working as expected.

*   **Run All Tests**: This command runs all the tests and gives you a coverage report (telling you how much of your code is tested).
    ```bash
    poetry run pytest -s -vvv --cov-report term-missing --cov=src tests/
    ```
*   **Run a Specific Test**: If you only want to run one test (for example, one you're working on).
    ```bash
    # Example: Replace with the actual path to your test function
    poetry run pytest -s -vvv --cov-report term-missing tests/server/test_server.py::TestWebSocketServer::test_websocket_connection
    ```

## :seedling: Developing

Here are some tools and practices used:
*   **Testing**: `pytest` is our go-to for writing and running tests.
*   **Code Formatting**: We use `black` to keep our Python code neat and consistent.
*   **Linting**: `flake8` helps us catch common code issues and maintain quality.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Remember those pre-commit hooks we installed? They run `black` and `flake8` automatically before you make a commit. This helps keep the codebase clean.

*   **Run Manually (If Needed)**: If you want to run all the pre-commit checks on all files at any time:
    ```bash
    poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
    ```
